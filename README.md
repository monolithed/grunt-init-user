> [grunt-init](http://gruntjs.com/project-scaffolding) template for associating user commits with an identity 


## Installation
If you haven't already done so, install grunt-init.

Once grunt-init is installed, place this template in your `~/.grunt-init/` directory. It's recommended that you use git to clone this template into that directory, as follows:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/monolithed/grunt-init-user.git ~/.grunt-init/node
```

*(Windows users, see the [documentation](http://gruntjs.com/project-scaffolding) for the correct destination directory path)*

### Usage

At the command-line, cd into an empty directory, run this command and follow the prompts.

```
grunt-init user
```

*Note that this template will generate files in the current directory, so be sure to change to a new directory first if you don't want to overwrite existing files.*
